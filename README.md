# Rivet-Detect

<p align="justify">
Rivet Detect is a project that has been developing as a college challenge. Our goal is to practice the knowledge about computer vision and apply it to openCv tools.</p> 

<p align="justify"> The project has been developing in Python language, that compared to other languages like C/C++, is slower and has some advantages when working with OpenCv.</p>
